Exploratory Data Analysis

- means we get comfortable with the data
- helps identify *magic features*
- should always be done before modelling

- get domain knowledge as it helps with a deeper understanding of the problem and the data
- check if the data is intuitive and agrees with the domain knowledge
- understand how the data was generated as it's crucial to establishing an appropriate model validation strategy


Anonymised data

- sometimes it's possible to decode the features and uncover the true meaning
- guess the feature type to perform appropriate pre-processing


Visualisations

- explore individual features using histograms, index vs value plots and statistics
- explore feature relation pairs with scatter plots and matrices (scatter plot/histogram combinations), and correlation plots
- explore feature groups with clustered/sorted correlation plots and sorted index vs feature statistic plots
