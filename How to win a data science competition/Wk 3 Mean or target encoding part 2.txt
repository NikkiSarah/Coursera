Correct Validation Process

- local experiments
	- estimate encodings on training data
	- map them to the training and validation data
	- regularise the training data
	- validate model on the training-validation data split

DON'T even think about encoding estimation before splitting the data

- submissions
	- estimate encodings on the entire training data
	- map them to the training and test data
	- regularise the training data (approach should have already been decided upon on at the local experiment stage)
	- fit the model to the training data


Advantages
	- compact transformation of categorical features
	- powerful basis for feature engineering

Disadvantages
	- Needs careful validation as there's many ways to overfit / target leakage
	- Significant improvements seen only on particular datasets
