Validation strategies

This page contains information about main validation strategies (schemes): holdout, K-Fold, LOO.

The main rule you should know â€” never use data you train on to measure the quality of your model. The trick is to split all your data into training and validation sets. 

Below you will find several ways to validate a model.

a) Holdout scheme:
    - Split train data into two parts: partA and partB.
    - Fit the model on partA, predict for partB.
    - Use predictions for partB for estimating model quality. Find such hyperparameters, that quality on partB is maximised.

b) K-Fold scheme:
    - Split train data into K folds. 
    - Iterate though each fold: retrain the model on all folds except current fold, predict for the current fold.
    - Use the predictions to calculate quality on each fold. Find such hyperparameters, that quality on each fold is maximised. You can also estimate the mean and variance of the loss. This is very helpful in order to understand the magnitude of the improvement.

c) LOO (Leave-One-Out) scheme:
    - Iterate over samples: retrain the model on all samples except the current sample, predict for the current sample. You will need to retrain the model N times (if N is the number of samples in the dataset).
    - In the end you will get LOO predictions for every sample in the training set and can calculate the loss.  

Notice, that these are validation schemes are supposed to be used to estimate the quality of the model. When you find the right hyperparameters and want to get test predictions don't forget to retrain your model using all the training data.
