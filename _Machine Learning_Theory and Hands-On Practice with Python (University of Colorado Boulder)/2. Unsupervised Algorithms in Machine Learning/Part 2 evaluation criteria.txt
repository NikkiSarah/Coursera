Evaluate the learner's response for question 1. Does the learner's response include the following?
- correctly uses the NMF function from the sklearn library
- The RMSE of the predictions from applying NMF on the sparse matrix or the dense matrix (fills unknown ratings with
  zeros) is way off. Learner's response shows this.

Evaluate the learner's response for question 2.

Here is a solution:

The NMF gives a poor performance here because the unknown ratings are kept as zeros in the matrix being factorized
(X in the X=WH). Because we use the Frobenius norm (or similar) loss function, having the source value as zero when the
actual value might be between 1-5 pushes the gradient and wrongly updates the values in W and H.

It can be fixed if we can mask out the components from the unknown values in X when we calculate the loss function, but
currently, the sklearn’s NMF does not have a way to change the loss function. You might try making this better by
imputing unknown ratings to 3 and applying NMF. The RMSE will be better than predicting everything to 3, but the loss
function still provides less than ideal gradient during optimization. You can also clip the values. In the
reconstructed matrix, W*H is clipped to 1-5.

Note:

Suppose one wants to use NMF for unsupervised rating prediction for a recommender system; one could use another Python
library like Surprise. However, using such a library might not be ideal for learning how things work under the hood.
That’s why we stick with sklearn in this course for learning purposes.

Includes both of the following: mentions that the zero values in X being the ground truth during the optimization is a
problem and mentions any idea(s) to reduce the error.
